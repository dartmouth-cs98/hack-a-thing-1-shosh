# hack-a-thing-1-shosh

Hello! This is my hack-a-thing-1 assignment for CS98. I know what you're thinking: this app is essentially useless. And you would be absolutely right in thinking that! But it's fun to play with. And not entirely useless to me! I learned a bit of how to use Swift, and am a lot more comfortable now in front-end Swift development. Woohoo! Enjoy :)
